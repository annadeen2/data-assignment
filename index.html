        <h3>Last year, the MTA announced that it would make changes to express bus service between the Bronx and Manhattan. These changes included cutting midday and evening routes, and rerouting two bus lines away from Central Park at Mount Sinai and Museum Mile. Due to overwhelming pushback from residents, the MTA delayed changes, which would have been implemented in fall 2020, for one year.</h3>
        <h3>Despite the delays in MTA changes, poor service still impacts Bronx residents. Read below to find out more.</h3>

For example, the BX3 bus (an express bus) is the most crowded bus in all five buroughs. This line serves Bronx Community College, which has an enrollment of 10,000+, and runs through areas hit the hardest by COVID-19. The BX3 bus line runs small buses, as opposed to the longer, accordion-style buses. </p>
